/**
* Phaser - http://www.phaser.io
*
* v1.0.0 - August 12th 2013
*
* A feature-packed 2D canvas game framework born from the firey pits of Flixel and
* constructed via plenty of blood, sweat, tears and coffee by Richard Davey (@photonstorm).
*
* Many thanks to Adam Saltsman (@ADAMATOMIC) for releasing Flixel, from both which Phaser
* and my love of game development originate.
